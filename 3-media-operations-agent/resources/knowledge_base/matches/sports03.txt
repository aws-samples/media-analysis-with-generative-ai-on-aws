PHOENIX TITANS' JACKSON IGNITES CROWD IN 92-84 WIN
March 28, 2024 - Sunset Center

Elite Basketball League (EBL) - The Sunset Center witnessed a defensive masterclass as the Phoenix Titans ground out a hard-fought victory over the visiting Storm Riders. Marcus Jackson (#14) led the orange-clad Titans with his all-around play, particularly in the third quarter where his chase-down block on Storm Riders' star Williams sparked a crucial 15-4 run. The defensive stop, which sent the rejected ball into the third row, had the capacity crowd on their feet and proved to be the turning point. "Our defense won us this game," praised Titans' head coach Mike Thompson. "Marcus's defensive intensity set the tone, and the team followed." The win marks the Titans' eighth straight home victory and solidifies their position in the playoff race.
