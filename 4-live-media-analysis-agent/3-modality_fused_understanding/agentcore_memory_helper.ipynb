    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ Basic memory creation and deletion\n",
    "2. ✅ Context manager usage (automatic cleanup)\n",
    "3. ✅ Multiple memory sessions\n",
    "4. ✅ Error handling\n",
    "5. ✅ Cleanup method\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- Memory names are automatically timestamped: `{name}_{YYYYMMDDHHMMSS}`\n",
    "- Events expire after 7 days by default (configurable)\n",
    "- Context manager ensures automatic cleanup\n",
    "- All operations are logged via component_monitor\n",
    "- Graceful error handling for all operations"
