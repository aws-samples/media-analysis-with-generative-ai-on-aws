In a high-stakes hearing held on March 23, 2023, at the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington, D.C., TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew faced a marathon five-hour questioning session before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The 118th Congress showed unprecedented unity in their concerns about the platform's data security practices and potential threats to American users.

Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA), speaking from the historic committee room, led the charge, stating, "TikTok collects nearly every data point imaginable—from people's locations to what they type and copy." Chew repeatedly assured lawmakers that Project Texas, a $1.5 billion initiative to store U.S. user data domestically, would address security concerns. However, many committee members remained skeptical of these guarantees.

The hearing, which took place in Room 2123 of the Rayburn Building, highlighted bipartisan momentum for comprehensive legislation addressing both national security concerns and youth safety on social media platforms. Several representatives cited internal documents showing TikTok's awareness of its addictive nature for teenage users.
