During a landmark hearing convened by the 118th Congress on March 23, 2023, at the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington, D.C., Congressional lawmakers zeroed in on TikTok's impact on children's mental health, revealing new data about the platform's algorithm and content moderation practices.

Democratic Representative Frank Pallone, speaking from the main committee room of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, emphasized that "while national security concerns are critical, we cannot ignore how TikTok's powerful algorithm pushes potentially harmful content to millions of young Americans." The committee presented internal research showing that users under 18 spend an average of 90 minutes daily on the platform.

TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, testifying before the packed Rayburn Building hearing room, defended the company's efforts to protect young users, highlighting features like screen time limits and content filtering. However, he faced criticism when unable to definitively answer questions about data access by ByteDance employees in China.

The historic hearing culminated in calls for new legislation combining data privacy protections with stricter requirements for social media platforms serving young users. Several committee members announced plans to introduce bipartisan bills addressing these concerns in the coming months.
