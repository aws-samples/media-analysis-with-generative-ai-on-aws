    "# Building an AI Sports Video Analysis Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook guides you through building an AI agent specialized in sports video analysis using Amazon Bedrock. Media broadcasters receive hundreds of thousands of video clips from sporting events that each need to be manually analyzed and tagged for downstream distribution channels. Some clips are published to websites, others to social media, and some are archived.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Each distribution channel has strict content compliance requirements. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Content Requirements (Sports):**\n",
    "- Include complete event/game name designation in all communications\n",
    "- Provide accurate venue details and location information\n",
    "- Clearly state the participating team names\n",
    "- Reference key player names prominent in the video\n",
    "\n",
    "**Distribution Requirements (Social Media):**\n",
    "- Limit content descriptions to 75 words maximum\n",
    "- Incorporate 2-3 relevant hashtags per post\n",
    "- Tag all applicable team/player social media handles\n",
    "- Maintain an approachable tone with light emoji\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem: Much of this required information is not present in the video footage itself. These gaps have traditionally required countless hours of manual labor, with human operators manually researching and filling in missing information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Our solution employs autonomous agents to automatically identify these gaps, perform lookups across various systems, and transform the data into compliant output formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Video Analysis:** Extract metadata from sports video clips using Amazon Bedrock Data Automation (BDA) to understand what's happening in the footage.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Knowledge Base Creation:** Build a sports match information knowledge base containing game details, venues, dates, and team information that can be searched semantically.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Player Database Integration:** Set up a DynamoDB table with player information (names, numbers, positions) that can be queried to identify players seen in videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sports Agent Development:** Create an AI agent that combines video analysis with knowledge base search and player lookups to automatically generate compliant content metadata.\n",
    "\n",

    "**What You Built:**\n",
    "- Processed sports video with Amazon Bedrock Data Automation (BDA)\n",
    "- Created a Knowledge Base with sports match information\n",
    "- Set up a DynamoDB table with player data\n",
    "- Built an agent with 2 custom tools that automatically fill information gaps\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Impact:**\n",
    "Instead of manual research to find venue details, player names, and game information, the agent automatically:\n",
    "- Identifies what's in the video (from BDA)\n",
    "- Looks up missing context (from Knowledge Base)\n",
    "- Retrieves player details (from DynamoDB)\n",
    "- Combines everything into compliant metadata\n",
