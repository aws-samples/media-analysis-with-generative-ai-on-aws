    "# Building an AI Film Analysis Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook guides you through building an AI agent specialized in film analysis using Amazon Bedrock (high level workflow of Bedrock Agent framework below). The agent you develop will combine video analysis with film knowledge base and celebrity recognition capabilities to automatically identify and analyze film content. Media companies, which have long struggled with processing and identifying film content across their vast libraries, can leverage these agents to automate traditionally manual tasks. What once took hours of human review—identifying clips, recognizing actors, and extracting metadata—can now be completed automatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Bedrock Agent](../../static/images/02-bedrock-agent.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Knowledge Base Creation:** You'll build a film information knowledge base by uploading data to S3 and configuring vector search. Once synchronized, this database enables your agent to accurately match and identify video content.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Film Agent Development:** You'll create the AI agent in Amazon Bedrock, configure it for film analysis, and connect it to your knowledge base. The agent uses foundation models to analyze content and match clips to source films.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Celebrity Detection Integration:** You'll add celebrity detection by integrating Lambda and DynamoDB, enabling your agent to recognize actors and retrieve their role information. This helps verify film identification through cast appearances.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Testing and Validation:** You'll test the agent's core functions to ensures accurate film identification through both content and cast analysis.\n",
